		<h2>Shortlist is a little experiment that let's you find and share your favourite bits of the Internet every day.</h2>
		<br>
		It simplifies a problem I (and a lot of other people) have had for some time. While there's a ton of awesome stuff on the Internet, my time is finite.
		So, here's the deal: Shortlist let's you <span>share up to 5 links every day</span>. It's that simple. These five links make up your daily Shortlist. They're your five favourite things on the Internet for that day. It could be a captivating article you read in the Atlantic or a picture of the sun eclipsing the Eiffel Tower that you took while on holiday. It could be a video of red panda playing in the snow or maybe it's that song you've had on loop in your head since breakfast. It's up to you. But you can only choose five things each day. So as a wise man named Ben once said, "With power comes great responsibility." Or something like that.
		<br><br>
		The next time you stumble across something awesome online and think "Oh wow. This is amazing" add it to your Shortlist. In the next few weeks I'll be rolling out features that let you follow other users and ranked lists of the best links every day.
		<br><br>
		If you've had a look around you can tell Shortlist places a lot of emphasis on the quality of content. Each Shorlist link or "Short" is built from the ground up to take advantage of displaying your favourite videos and picture in all their glory. Essentially, the higher the resolution — the better. I really hope that this design will push people to share higher quality content and expand upon the status quo of link sharing websites.
		<br><br>
		Your job is simple: share your favourite things on the Internet each day. Oh — and enjoy all the awesome things other people are sharing.
		<br><br>
		And we're just getting started.
