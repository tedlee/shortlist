I follow a lot of really awesome, smart, and downright intelligent people on Twitter. Alas, I often don't have the time to go through and find all of my friends cool links they shared each day. So I came up with Shortlist. It's a little experiment in putting constraints on link sharing — in the best way!

Here's the deal: you can share 3 links everyday on Shortlist. These three links make up your daily Shortlist. They're your three favourite things on the internet for that day. It could be a captivating article you read. A picture of a sunset eclipsing a tower you took. It could be a video of red panda playing in the snow. Or maybe it's that song you've had on loop in your head since breakfast. It's up to you. But you can only choose three things each day. So as a wise man named Ben once said, "With power comes great responsability."

Shortlist places a lot of emphasis on quality of content. Each Shorlist link or Short as we call them is optimized for high-res video and pictues. Essentially, the higher the resolution — the better. We hope that this design will push people to share higher photos and video.
