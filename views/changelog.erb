			Today was all about integrating new source type support for inline display. After some deliberation I switched from the Flash based YouTube player to the HTML5 embeddable version. While the HTML5 version is widely used I find the it to be much snappier and feels lighter-weight but I haven't yet instrumented the difference between the two players. It also scales nicer when changing the width of the DOM. I also added support for Vimeo and Soundcloud links today which I'm pretty stoked about.

			Well look at that â€” you can now authenticate as a user! Fortunately DataMapper has a nice little BCrypt property that when working in tandem with Warden (auth gem) you end up with a pretty simple way to handle authentication and passwords. Integrating this with Sinatra was easier than I thought it would be and things seem to be pretty stable. Also added NewRelic support today for availability monitoring. Since I'm hosting on the free Heroku tier at the moment, typically applications 'sleep' after 5 minutes of inactivity. To avoid this, I've set NewRelic up to ping the site for "availability monitoring" every 30 seconds which should negate the 5 second or so "wake-up" time that is typically incurred after the app goes to sleep. It's quite hacky but it solves the problem at least until I need to worry more about scaling.

			Switched to using GitHub issues for tracking project progress and features/milestones and I have to say I'm really enjoying it. I've started to organize features into weekly sprint milestones which I find helps keep me motivated and at the same time quantitatively instrument progress.

			I often wonder when something you're building goes from being a mis-mash of code that sort of works to something that looks enjoyable to use. I think today was that day. Working through the user profiles I'm really happy with how they look. It's simple with a big focus on the content. As of now it doesn't show link based on date but rather the three most recently submitted links. I need to figure out a way to deal with the three links a day limit. Still mulling that over. I'm really happy with how adding picture links works. It's not perfect but when an image (.png/.bmp/.gif/.jpg) is added it's used as the background for that Shortlists cover. And it scales really nicely! 
			<br/><br/>
			I was going to use embed.ly for doing links but found their jQuery plugin to be slow and not as customizable as I would have liked. So I went the route of writing my own embed code. It works but running a regex against a link to check if it is A) a YouTube link B) to grab the videoID I need for embedding. There are a handful of ways YouTube formats their links so refining the regex was a pain but it seems to work well on all links I'm posted so far. Deciding how the videos would scale horizontally was a bit of a challenge. Initially I wanted the video player to be 16:9 but obviously that led to problems with how you choose the right height for the video. I settled for videos that were 100% width of their parent space (so they take up the entire 'cover' area) and set a hard height value at 550px. 550px is larger than most other cover images but it leads to a better viewing experience. The embedded YouTube player is smart enough to stick to those constraints but add bars either along the bottom or along the sides of a video depending on the aspect ratio of the video and the current width of the browser window.

			Tomorrow I want to have a look at adding a property to the Link class so users can select a media type. Also I'll probably add in the handy moment.js library for handling date manipulations. And maybe deploy to Heroku :)

			Major day of progress today. I finally got my User and Link class relationships in order. Users now have n many links which are displayed on their profile page. User profile pages now dynamically pulls up the avatar from when the user signed up. The front page now lists recently added links. Also began work on the UI of profile pages while taking into consideration of how things look on mobile. I'm likely going have to roll mobile custom CSS at some point but trying to avoid going down that rabbit hole at this point. More work on profile pages tomorrow and hopefully can begin to look at implementing embed.ly for links.
